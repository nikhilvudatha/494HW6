# Argumentative Vis

To create a pair of data visualizations that promote opposing viewpoints using the same base dataset.

Your completed submission should have the following files:
* `index.html`: The webpage with the visualizations.
* `data/`: The folder containing your dataset file(s).
* Any other necessary files like CSS, JS, etc.

## Design requirements

Using techniques from the storytelling lecture, you will create two visualizations about a dataset that frame the data with opposite narratives.

First, find a dataset about a "controversial" topic. In other words, a topic with strong opinions on both sides of the issue. Here are some examples of topics that could work: a political issue, science, religion, sociocultural, economics, immigration, sports, climate change, geopolitical sovereignty, etc. Topics from other regions or countries are also allowed. Good places to look for this data include Kaggle and news organizations that provide access to their data (538, New York Times, etc.).

This topic is NOT allowed: **COVID-19**. Though, you are free to look at examples of opposing COVID visualizations for inspiration.

Next, create your `index.html` page with two visualizations placed side-by-side (one on the left, one on the right). The two visualizations should use the same dataset. Not all attributes are required to be the the same, and you are free to preprocess the data differently for each visualization (if desired), including aggregating data, filtering data, etc. but use the same source must be used. (In other words, you cannot go find two datasts and merge them together.) One visualization should be rhetorically framed to argue "in support" of a viewpoint, and the other visualization should be rhetorically framed to argue against the viewpoint.

Again, the trick is that you will use the _same dataset_ for both visualizations. You'll use rhetorical techniques to frame the data in opposing ways. Some examples of how you might do this include: filtering some of the data, picking different attributes to show, using diffrent ranges (timescales, etc), using different granularities, clustering or binning the data, using text annotating on the charts, picking colors or channels to emphasize some aspect of the data. You're allowed to pre-process the data or break up the data into multiple files if necessary.
