        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 3%; margin-top: 2%">Description: This visualization shows the number of votes received by
            all counties within each of the 52 states for Donald J. Trump. This shows the discrepancy among all 52 states on how the different views
            of each state's county changed from Trump to Biden. It is honestly shocking how many people seriously voted for Trump when looking at the
            higher bars.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 3%">
            The rhetorical methods used in this visualization are omission of data that obscures the result and keeps the data
            visualization simple for users to read and interpret. Metonymy is also used in attempts to isolate only Donald Trump's votes among all
            52 states.

        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 3%; margin-top: 2%">Description: This visualization shows the number of votes received by
            all counties within each of the 52 states for Joe Biden. This shows the discrepancy among all 52 states on how the different views
            of each state's county changed from Biden to Trump. From viewing this data it has shown how many people came to their senses and elected a
            president that can pronounce simple words correctly.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 3%; margin-top: 2%">
            The rhetorical methods used in this visualization are also omission and metonymy, however there are also contrast techniques applied
            as seeing the chart to the left gives a better idea in the differences to the chart for Biden. There is also a visual metaphor and metonymy as the red and blue correspond to the Republican and Democratic Parties.
